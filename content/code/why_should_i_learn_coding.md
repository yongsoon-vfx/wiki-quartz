## Why should I learn coding as a CG Artist?

Learning coding will allow you to automate repetitive boring tasks that waste your time. Tasks such as encoding a image sequence into a mp4 every time you finish a new render, tagging renders with text overlays, or even creating a montage with different sets of renders.

It also helps you to solve problems by changing the way you think, breaking down each problem into step-by-step instructions, which is a very important skill for Houdini. 

By coding in either VEX or Python for Houdini, you can work directly with geometry on the lowest level and you can do virtually anything as long as you can code it.

All popular CG programs use Python modules to interface with the user, and also expose the underlying framework in Python. So if you want to extend the functionality of your favorite CG program, chances are, you have to use Python one way or another.
