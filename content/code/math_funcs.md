# Matrices and Transforms

## Transformation Matrix

The transform, rotation, and scale of an object can be represented with a 3x3 matrix. A [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix) matrix represents an object with no transforms, rotations, and with a scale of 1 1 1.

$identity =\begin{vmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\end{vmatrix}$

Then, you apply the matrix by multiplying it with the current position to perform the transformation

```c
matrix3 m = ident();

vector axis = {0,1,0};  //vector to rotate around
float angle = ch('angle'); //angle to rotate in radians

rotate(m,angle,axis);
@P *= m; 

//-----------------------------------------------------------
//You can also create a translation and rotation matrix
scale(m,{2,2,2,}); //scales the matrix by 2 in all axes
translate(m,{1,2,0}); //translates the matrix 1 unit in x and 2 units in y
```

## Creating a Transform Matrix given 3 vector axes

```c
vector x = {1,0,0};
vector y = {0,1,0};
vector z = {0,0,1};
//normalized vectors

4@xform = 
	set( x[0], x[1], x[2], 0,
	     y[0], y[1], y[2], 0,
	     z[0], z[1], z[2], 0,
	     0 , 0 , 0 , 1);
```

# Vectors & Quaternions

## Finding Angle between 2 Vectors

$\Theta = \arccos \frac{a\cdot b}{\left | a \right |\left | b \right |}$

The angle between any two vectors is given by the formula above, where a is vector 1 and b is vector 2. The following is an implementation of the formula in Vex

```c
vector v1 = {0,1,0};
vector v2 = {1,0,0};


f@theta = acos(
    (dot(v1,v2))/ 
    (v1 * v2) 
    );
```

## Find Normal vector of plane given 3 points (A,B,C)

![[face-vector.png]]

Both N vectors are equal

$\vec{N} = normalize( (B-A) \times (C-A) )$

## Dot Product

![[dot-product-illustration.png]]

nice drawing

$vector1 *vector2 = scalar$﻿

A dot product outputs a scalar value (from -1 to 1) that represents how similar the direction of 2 (normalized) vectors are.

If v1 is facing the same direction as v2, the dot product is 1

If v1 is facing the opposite direction as v2, the dot product is -1

If v1 is perpendicular to v2, the dot product is 0

  

This is useful for masking faces that face a certain direction, eg: masking all faces that face up for a snow accumulation effect.

```c
vector v1 = {1,0,0};
vector v2 = {0,1,0};
//normalize the vectors or the float output will be out of range
f@dp = dot(v1,v2);
```

  

  

## The Dreaded Quaternions

Quaternions are 4-dimensional vectors that define a rotation ( orientation ) in space. In Houdini you can easily manipulate quaternions using the built-in vex functions. (And you don’t have to do the math)

Quaternion rotation is preferred over Euler rotations as it does not suffer from gimbal lock, which is the loss of freedom in one axis after performing Euler rotations.

You can use quaternions to specify the rotation of points to be instanced onto, using the @orient attribute. The quaternion() function also readily converts a transformation matrix into a quaternion.

```c
//------------Creating a quaternion from a matrix3
matrix3 m = ident();
vector axis = {1,0,0};  //vector to rotate around
float angle = ch('angle'); //angle to rotate in radians
//same as above

vector4 orient = quaternion(m); //create quaternion from matrix

p@orient = orient; //if you are instancing objects onto points with rotation

//------------Some Useful Quaternion Functions---------------
qrotate(orient,{0,1,0}); //rotates {0,1,0} by the given quaternion
qmultiply(q1,q2); //multiplies two quaternions

vector4 dihedral(v1,v2); //takes two vectors and computes the quaternion 
matrix3 dihedral(v1,v2); //or matrix that rotates v1 onto v2

slerp(q1,q2,weight); //Interpolates between two quaternions using weight attribute

qconvert(q1); //converts quaternion to a matrix3
quaterniontoeuler(q1); //converts a quaternion to an euler vector
```

There are a few other functions in vex related to manipulating quaternions that you can refer to [here](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/vex/functions/quaternion.html). The ones that I’ve listed above are just the most commonly used operations.

# Other Functions

## Choose Function

${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$

The choose function represents how many permutations there are in choosing _k_ items from a set with a total number of _n_ items.

For example, 9 choose 2 would result in 36, meaning there are 36 unique pairs of items within the set.
