## Pattern Matching Prims in Solaris
[Houdini Documentation](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/solaris/pattern.html)

## Reference LOP
Reference LOP is used for combining a main stage with a specific prim from another stage. Think of it as copy and pasting a folder in a specific directory into another folder.

usda.usd
>/ 
>>Chair 
>>>chair_geo 
>>>chair_mtl 
>>>>material1 

usdb.usd
>/
>>mtl 
>>>blue 
>>>pink 

Using a Reference LOP and setting the `Primitive Path` to `/Chair/chair_mtl` and the `Reference Primitive Path` to `/mtl/` will merge all of `mtl`'s children primitives onto `chair_mtl` creating the following:
>/
>>Chair
>>>chair_geo
>>>chair_mtl
>>>>material1 
>>>>blue 
>>>>pink 

## Restructure Scene Graph LOP
>Reparent Primitives  
>Rename Primitives  
>Remove Primitives  

## Prune LOP
>Used for making primitives invisible or deactivated  
>Invisible means that other primitives in your scene can still interface with the invisible prim, for example, for constraints  
>Inactive essentially suspends the prim and it is unable to be affected by any operations until you reactivate it  

## Configure Primitive LOP
>Used for changing basically every USD property of a prim  
>Most importantly, you use this node to **change the active/visibility state** of a prim  

## Store Parameter Values LOP
 >Workaround by Houdini to create and store temporary values  
 >Creates a prim at `/HoudiniLayerInfo` with the attributes  
 >This prim is not saved out when saving out the USD with `USD ROP` 
 >
 >You can access the attribute in an expression with a helper function in `loputils` or you can access it manually using [[python#Example Code to get a Usd.Prim and attribute|Python]].
 >```python
>import loputils
>this_node = hou.pwd()
>input_node = this_node.inputs()[0]
>val = loputils.fetchParameterValues(input_node,"yourValue")
>
>return str(val)
 >```
